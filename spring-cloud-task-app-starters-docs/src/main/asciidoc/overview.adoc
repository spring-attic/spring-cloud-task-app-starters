== Spring Cloud Task Starters

This section goes into more detail about how you can work with Spring Cloud Task Starters as standalone applications or with Spring Cloud Data Flow.
It assumes familiarity with general Spring Cloud Task concepts, which can be found in the Spring Cloud Task
http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-task/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/[reference documentation].

=== Introduction

Spring Cloud Task Application Starters provide you with predefined Spring Cloud Task applications that you can run independently or with Spring Cloud Data Flow.
You can also use the starters as a basis for creating your own applications.  They include commonly used tasks that can
run as is or be modified to your needs.

=== Starters and pre-built applications

As a user of Spring Cloud Task Application Starters you have access to two types of artifacts.

_Starters_ are libraries that contain the complete configuration of a Spring Cloud Task application with a specific role
(e.g. an _JDBC HDFS_ that migrates data from a JDBC Repository via sql query to a file on hdfs).
Starters are not executable applications, and are intended to be included in other Spring Boot applications.

_Prebuilt applications_ are Spring Boot applications that include the starters.
Prebuilt applications are http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application-executable-jar[uberjars] and include minimal code required to execute standalone.

[NOTE]
Only starters are present in the source code of the project.
Prebuilt applications are generated according to the Maven plugin configuration.

==== Maven and Docker accesss

Starters are available as Maven artifacts in the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Spring-repository-FAQ[Spring repositories]. You can add them as dependencies to your application, as follows:

[source,xml]
```
<dependency>
  <group>org.springframework.cloud.task.app</group>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-task-timestamp</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

From this, you can infer the coordinates for other starters found in this guide.
While the version may vary, the group will always remain `org.springframework.cloud.task.app` and the artifact id follows the naming convention `spring-cloud-starter-task-<functionality>`.

Prebuilt applications are available as Maven artifacts too.
It is not encouraged to use them directly as dependencies, as starters should be used instead.
Following the typical Maven `<group>:<artifactId>:<version>` convention, they can be referenced for example as:

```
org.springframework.cloud.task.app:timestamp-task:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
```

Just as with the starters, you can infer the coordinates for other prebuilt applications found in the guide.
The group will be always `org.springframework.cloud.task.app`.
The version may vary.
The artifact id follows the format `<functionality>-task`.

*Docker TBD*

==== Building the artifacts

You can also build the project and generate the artifacts (including the prebuilt applications) on your own.
This is useful if you want to deploy the artifacts locally, for example for adding a new starter.

First, you need to generate the prebuilt applications.
This is done by running the application generation Maven plugin.
You can do so by simply invoking the corresponding script in the root of the project.

```
./generate.sh

```

Then build the applications:

```
cd apps

mvn clean install
```

For the each of the prebuilt applications, the script will generate the following items:

* `pom.xml` file with the required dependencies
* a class that contains the `main` method of the application and imports the predefined configuration
* generated integration test code that exercises the component.


=== Creating custom artifacts

In this section we will describe how to create your own application.

==== Creating your own applications

Spring Cloud Task Application Starters consists of regular Spring Cloud Task applications with some additional conventions that facilitate generating prebuilt applications.
Sometimes, your solution may require additional applications that are not in the scope of Spring Cloud Task Application Starters, or require additional tweaks and enhancements.
In this section we will show you how to create custom applications that can be part of your solution, along with Spring Cloud Task application starters.
You have the following options:

* create new Spring Cloud Task applications;
* use the starters to create customized versions;


===== Using generic Spring Cloud Task applications

If you want to add your own custom applications to your solution, you can simply create a new Spring Cloud Task project and run it the same way as the applications provided by Spring Cloud Task Application Starters, independently or via Spring Cloud Data Flow.
The process is described in the http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-task/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started#_getting_started[Getting Started Guide] of Spring Cloud Task.

===== Using the starters to create custom components

You can also reuse the starters provided by Spring Cloud Task Application Starters to create custom components, enriching the behavior of the application.
For example, you can add a special behavior to your _jdbc hdfs_ task, to do some post processing following the migration of the data.
As a reminder, this involves:

* adding the starter to your project for example:
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
  <!- other dependencies -->
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.cloud.task.app</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-task-timestamp</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

* adding the main class and importing the starter configuration for example:
[source,java]
----
package org.springframework.cloud.task.app.timestamp;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Import;


@SpringBootApplication
@Import(org.springframework.cloud.task.app.timestamp.TimestampTaskConfiguration.class)
public class TimestampTaskApplication {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
                SpringApplication.run(TimestampTaskApplication.class, args);
        }
}
----

After doing so, you can simply add the additional configuration for the extra features of your application.
