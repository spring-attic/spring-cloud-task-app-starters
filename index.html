{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring Cloud Task Application Starters are [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) 
applications that may be any process including [Spring Batch](http://projects.spring.io/spring-batch/) 
jobs that do not run forever, and they end/stop at some point. Spring Cloud Task Applications can 
be used with [Spring Cloud Data Flow](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/) to create, deploy, 
and orchestrate short-lived data microservices.

{% endcapture %}

{% capture main_content %}

Spring Cloud Task Application Starters are standalone executable applications that can be used for 
on-demand use-cases such as database migration, machine learning, and scheduled operations. 
These applications can run independently on variety of runtime platforms including: Cloud Foundry, 
Apache Yarn, Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, Docker, or even on your laptop.

## Features

* Run standalone as Spring Boot applications
* Orchestrate as ephemeral data microservices
* Consume data microservice applications as maven or docker artifacts
* Override configuration parameters via command-line, environment variables, or YAML file
* Provide infrastructure to test the applications in isolation
* Download as starters from this version of [Spring Initializr](http://start-scs.cfapps.io/)

## Available Applications

| __Task__ |
| ------- |
| spark-client |
| spark-cluster |
| spark-yarn |
| timestamp |

## Quick Start

Step 1 - Download the latest _timestamp_ application from [here](http://repo.spring.io/libs-release/org/springframework/cloud/task/app/timestamp-task/) [eg: /1.1.0.RELEASE/timestamp-task-1.1.0.RELEASE.jar]

Step 2 - Run *timestamp* application
```
java -jar timestamp-task-***.jar
```

Step 3 - Verify *timestamp* logs in console 

Step 4 - Verify *timestamp* application shutsdown
